<h1>TV Production Intro</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Welcome to TV Production!</h2>
<p>
In this class, you'll learn the real experience of planning, shooting, and editing videos with a variety of prompts, equipment, and settings. This short intro will run you through what you can expect out of the class, and guide you on where to go next.
</p>

<h2>Meet Mr. O'Day</h2>
<p>
Meet your fearless guide through the world of TV Production, Mr. O'Day! He has over 30 years of experience at the Career Center, and half a decade working with NOVA. Trust him, he knows what he's talking about.
<br>
Mr. O'Day's class works on mutual respect, trust, and dialogue. He's far from strict! As long as you show that you can be responsible and know what you're doing, the class is yours. But remember, he'll never be too far away to help if you need it!

<h2>The Classroom</h2>
<p>
In TV Production, the world is your oyster! When you're on a shoot, as long as you have the necessary permission, you can pretty much go anywhere (don't abuse this power). However, there are two main rooms that you'll spend the most time in.
</p>
<h3>The Studio</h3>
<p>
The TV studio is one of the largest closed rooms in the building, but with all the stuff in there, it doesn't always feel like it. When you're in the studio, handle everything with care and respect. The equipment stored there is <i>very</i> expensive, and although most of it is built to last, you don't want to be the one to break it.
<br>
The studio is where live-broadcast videos are recorded, and where you might shoot if you want lots of control over the set. Speaking of control, you'll notice a large window looking into the studio. That's the control room, and unless you get explicit permission you should stay out of it. What you can go into (usually) is on the other side of the hall: Mr. O'day's office.
<br>
Other Hotspots in the Studio:
<ul>
 <li>Green Screen Room/VO Booth</li>
 <li>(Dusty) Equipment Room</li>
 <li>The Switchboard (<i>if you can find it</i>)</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<h3>The Editing Room</h3>
