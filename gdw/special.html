	<h1>Special Characters</h1>

<!-- content starts below here -->
Since &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; have special meanings in HTML, you can't use their characters by themselves. Instead, you have to use some "special characters" to represent them. For example, to have a "less than" sign appear in your document, you need to use &amp;lt; to represent it.
